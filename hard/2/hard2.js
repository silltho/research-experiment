  Task
  Write a function calculate that, given a list of rectangles, finds the area
  of their union.

  Each rectangle is represented by four integers [x0, y0, x1, y1], where 
  (x0, y0) is the lower-left corner and (x1, y1) is the upper-right corner. 
  The origin (0, 0) is bottom left. For the representation used for your 
  language, see the example tests.

  Constraints
  Performance requirement: 10 tests with n ≤ 5000, and 10 tests with 
  n ≤ 20,000
  Coordinates: 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 1,000,000
