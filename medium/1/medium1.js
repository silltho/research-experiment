  Task
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we 
  get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
  
  Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 
  below the number passed in.
  
  Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
  
  Note
  If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

  Once the task is completed, please inform the researcher first and then fill out this form:
